possible names: `Doodle Frames`, `HandDrawnFX`, `WobbleFX`, `wobble swobble`, `Wobbler`, `Wobbledit`, `Wobble Paint`, `Wobble Frames`

# How to develop

make sure you installed python(minimum version 3.12)
`py -m venv venv`(if on windows) or `python3 -m venv venv`(if on linux)
activate the environment
and then do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## TODO:

for this time, just focus on making an mvp. No drawing stuff. Just get the file user drops into the window. apply fx and return as spreadsheet/gif

I might, in the future, fork this repo to work on a version that allows painting over stuff too.

## UI

UI will be made in pygame side, using mili-ui. The images for the ui will be made in the program itself. It should have an unique aesthetic to it.
